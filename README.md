# Landing on the moon

Miniproject | Learning to land on the moon through Deep Reinforcement Learning

LunarLander-v2 is a game environment provided by OpenAI. The purpose of the project was to implement a model able to safely land on a specific point of the surface of the moon. 

We did it by implementing the gradient-based RL algorithm commonly known as REINFORCE in a neural network. Refer to the notebook landing_on_the_moon_rl.ipynb for more information and the code of our implementation.
